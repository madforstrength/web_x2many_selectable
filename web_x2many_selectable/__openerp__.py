Description
-----------
This widget adds the capability for selecting multiple records in x2many fields and calls a python function with the ids as argument.

Its really easy to use, just add widget=x2many_selectable on any x2many field.

e.g. <field name="course_id" widget="x2many_selectable">
        <tree>
            <field name="title" />
        </tree>
    </field>

You can get the selected records in python function, a smple python function is as follows:

@api.multi
def bulk_verify(self):
    for record in self:
	print record

By default the widget will pick model from x2many field and default function name is "bulk_verify".
You can change the model as well as python function name from javascript.
